# COMP3651-AI
I learned about AI and related concepts in this course, including regression, computer vision, and search algorithms.

I developed an implementation of the multivariate linear regression machine learning technique using the L2 norm error function to learn polynomial functions in the _multilinear_DM.py_ file.

I developed implementations for the breadth-first and _A*_ search algorithms to test their efficiency at transforming scrambled 3x3 puzzles into ordered ones by sliding one tile at a time into the empty space in the _slidingpuzzle_Danae_Morrison.py_ file.

I implemented a local search algorithm for a constraint satisfaction problem in _localsearch_csp_DM.py_.
